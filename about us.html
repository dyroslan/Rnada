<p>Hi everyone! I hope you'll have a nice visit here. Check it out.

<p align="justify">In doing business, we need a good strategy or planning for the continous of our business in the future. Alexander Osterwalder said a Business Model describes the rational of how an organizations or a person creates, delivers and captures value (Eric Saint-Andre,2016).
The purpose, strategies, business process and target customer are some of the core aspects represented in a business. As we know nowadays have many people involve in doing business so, after our discussion about our planning to build a shop, we decide to open a bakery shop.</justify></p> 

<p align="justify">The R'NADA Kitchen is an Malay-style bakery that established in 2019 to bring people to the full Malay environment when they enter into our bakery shop. This bakery only have one shop and it is the HQ. It is opened on Jalan Dato Maharaja Lela in Kuala Kangsar, Perak since 2019.</justify></p>

<p align="justify">This R'NADA Bakery is a new bakery shop that established with cooperation by five young people that want to try their skills and knowledge in doing a business. They are graduated from University of Technology MARA in 
Information Management studies. From the first time they get the idea to build this bakery shop is when they doing some research in the internet about what they should do after they was graduated. They already have knowledge in the important things that was needed to build a business 
which is management skills. From that, they want to grab this opportunity to improve theirselve to try do something new in their youth time. As we know, an organization should have team members that must know how to manage and organize the organization.</justify></p>

<p align="justify">As a beginner, we have decide to corperate together to build a bakery shop. It is because we want to learn and gain knowledge and experience as much as we can for our first shop. We want to give a try for ourself and give full of effort for this bakery to be one of the known bakery by 
the community. This bakery already have we (5 person) as business partner, thats why we only have one or two employee. Nur Diyanah Roslan, appointed as the head manager of this business. The main desserts that we sell is cikuya (cookies & kuih raya), cake and special juice.</justify></p>
